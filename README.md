Notes:
```
	¹) Some of these features may be available only in the development branch (dev).
	²) The extended man system (#man) requires you to use a bigger console size (/consize 15), 
		because most of those manpages have more than the usual 5 console lines.
	³) The Unix-like command syntax is not available for all commands.
	⁴) Some of this commands should not be used, that's why they are disabled.
